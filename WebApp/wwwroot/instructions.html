                                    This page aims to explain the basics of an already basic game. That being said, its existence is mostly attributed to the lack of in-game tutorial.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The game is relatively simple. You through multiple levels fighting enemies of increasing difficulty while also trying to score high on the leaderboard.
                                    Memebers of the page can choose the playstyle that best suits their skillset. Attempting to achieve the highest possible score
                                    can prove meaningless if you die, as the reward will be minimal despite the high risk, since the rewards for completion are higher.
                                </p>

                            <h1 class="blockTitle"> Movement </h1>

                                    Players can only move in a T-shaped grid. That means they can only set their position on a section of the grid at a certain time
                                    and can't be active while moving.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Movement is exclusive to the <span class="keyMarker">WASD</span> keys (and desktop users, sorry).
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Once they've pressed either of the keys, players will move to their asigned position automatically and can't move back it until they've reched it.
                                    They can also initiate a dodge while changing their location by holding down <span class="keyMarker">SHIFT</span> when moving, which will give them brief
                                    invincibility after a short delay while moving, but once they reach their position the lose said invincibility and hav to recover for a moment before
                                    they can perform any action, which leaves them vulnerable.
                                </p>

                                    Players will face a single enemy on every level. It's positioned just over the center so it can attack (and can be attacked) the player
                                    on the top lane. However, enemies can also block the player if he remains down at the bottom sector of the playable grid, in which case
                                    the player will no longer be able to move on the grid during the current encounter and can only jump to avoid enemy attacks with <span class="keyMarker">W</span>
                                    (he can still dodge though).
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Players can attack their enemies with <span class="keyMarker">SPACE</span>. When to the side, their attacks take a little longer to reach the enemy.
                                    They can't attack while moving and shortly after being hit. They do, however, also gain brief invincibility after a hit.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    There are 2 types of enemies. The first one has a higher chance of being encountered. It can attack the player normally on the top lane and block them on the lower,
                                    but it also has a chance of nullifying their recovery time after an attack. The second enemy can't do that, but can instead sometimes
                                    initiate an attack which starts from its head instead of its side and once it reaches the 'ground' it spreads to both sides horizontally.
                                    It also has higher health and damage.
                                </p>
                            </div>

                                    Each game ends after the player either defeats their last enemy or is defeated and sends them back to the starting screen.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    When starting the game, players can choose a class, each of which has different stats (see below). They can't change thier class after starting the game.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Each level has an enemy the player has to defeat, whose type is randomly picked and its stats increase after a set of levels.
                                    After defeating their enemy, the player can choose a single upgrade from a list (or not and receive extra points).
                                    Defeating enemies also increases the player's current balance, which they can spend on a shop, three of which generate on a random level
                                    during the game. Players can purchase every upgrade from the shop as opposed to only on after clearing an encounter. Spending money, however,
                                    lowers their score.
                                </p>

                                    <li>Normal: The player starts with a standart amount of health, speed and attack damage.</li>
                                    <li>Tank: Has much higher health, but decreased speed. That makes attacks much harder to dodge.</li>
                                    <li>Glass Cannon: Has very high damage, but lower health, so it can both easily demolish or be demolished by starting enemies.</li>
                                    <li>Thief: Has higher speed and health. Probably overpowered.</li>
